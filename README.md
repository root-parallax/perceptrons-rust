# perceptrons-rust

a __perceptron__ is the simplest neural network possible: a computational model of a single neuron. A perceptron consists of one or more inputs, a processor, and a single output.

### History

__Introduced in the late 50's - Minsky and Papert:__
Among the main results is a theorem which relates the group of transformations which leaves a class of patterns invariant to equiva- lence classes of predicates of a perceptron designed to recognize this class. The theorem says that all predicates in an equivalence class can be made to have equal weight. It is useful in proving that certain things cannot be done, and also in the actual design of perceptrons which recognize a class of pictures with many symmetries.

__Perceptron convergence theorem Rosenblatt, 1962:__
Perceptron will learn to classify any linearly seperable set of inputs.
